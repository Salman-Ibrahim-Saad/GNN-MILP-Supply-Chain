# GNN-MILP Supply Chain Optimization

This repository contains research code and data for integrating **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** with **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** to solve supply chain optimization problems.  
The project explores demand forecasting, network optimization, and end-to-end decision-making for resilient and efficient supply chains.

## âš¡ Objectives
- Apply **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for demand forecasting and graph representation of the supply chain.  
- Develop **MILP models** for production, distribution, and routing optimization.  
- Integrate GNN forecasts into MILP formulations for **data-driven decision-making**.  
- Demonstrate use cases such as **EV Routing (EVRP, SDEVRP)** and **Disaster-Resilient Network Design (INDP)**.
